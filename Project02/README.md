## Part 3 
- The simpleapp I made is "Aim Trainer"
- The app is made to test your accuracy. Targets are spawned and dispawned one after another.
- If you hit the target, it counts as a hit, and if you hit the background, it counts as a miss. Shots are counted every time you click.
- The accuracy is calculated by # of hit divided by # of shots
- The target counter at the top left is just there to show how many targets have popped up.
